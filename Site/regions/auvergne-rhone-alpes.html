            <h2>Presentation of the region :</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is a French administrative region located in the central and eastern parts of southern France. Bringing together the former Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes regions, it is made up of 12 departments and a metropolis with territorial authority status, its capital is Lyon. This new region brings together spaces that are very different from each other, both geographically, as well as sociological, economic, or even cultural, as was already the case for Rhône-Alpes, and, to a lesser extent, for Auvergne. If the former Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions each benefit from a coherence linked to the axes of communication and the attraction of their respective metropolis, the new group appears heterogeneous and has aroused strong opposition from certain local elected officials as well as from part of the population when it was created.</p>
