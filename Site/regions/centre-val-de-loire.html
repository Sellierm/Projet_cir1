            <h2>Presentation of the region :</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Center-Val de Loire is a French administrative region that brings together three historic provinces: Berry, Orléanais, and Touraine. The south-eastern end of the territory was part of a fourth province: Bourbonnais. Part of the region is located in the natural region of the Loire Valley. Its population density is 66 inhabitants / km², or half that of metropolitan France, which makes it a sparsely populated region. The population density is higher on the Loire axis where half of the population lives. The region is made up of six departments: Cher, Eure-et-Loir, Indre, Indre-et-Loire, Loir-et-Cher and Loiret.</p>

            <h2>Important places to visit :</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Amboise :</u></strong> The jewel in the crown of the Loire Valley, Amboise is an obvious choice for visitors. The town was once the beating heart of power and art. As proof, Charles VIII and François I established their residence in the castle of Amboise.
                It is worth noting that it is also the burial place of Leonardo da Vinci. To learn more about this Renaissance genius, visit Clos Lucé, his last home. If you don't know what to do in the Centre Val de Loire after these visits, we recommend the Mini-Châteaux park. One walk is enough to contemplate all the castles of the Loire, in miniature!</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Blois :</u></strong> Continue on to Blois, where another castle is nestled. A rival to Amboise, it was home to many personalities of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Walk in the footsteps of Anne of Brittany, Charles V, Pierre de Ronsard, Louis XII and many others. After this journey through time, vary the pleasures at the astonishing Maison de la magie, as well as in the gardens of the former bishop's palace.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The Zoo of Beauval :</u></strong> Don't look for anything else to do in the Centre Val de France. Follow us to the Beauval ZooPark! Meet the 35,000 animals protected in the zoo. And to observe them in a surprising way, the zoo has planned gondolas flying over different territories.
                You can also complete your day with a bird show or a visit to the equatorial dome. This new feature invites you to plunge into the heart of the jungle. That's all we have to say.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The Castle of Chambord :</u></strong> More than 5,000 hectares make up the Chambord estate. At its centre, the castle is a nugget created at the instigation of François I. However, this ambitious project was not completed until Louis XIV. There are over 60 rooms, terraces and formal gardens.
                However, the key element of the majestic building is the double-revolving staircase, attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. This masterpiece allows two people to go up and down without seeing each other. Experience it for yourself!</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The troglodytes :</u></strong> The region is dotted with dwellings dug into the tuffeau, a porous limestone rock. To see a large number of troglodytes, go to Troo, nicknamed the "capital of troglodytism". Some of the dwellings date back to the Middle Ages!
                There are also a few mushroom farms in troglodytes deep in the cliffs. The dark and humid atmosphere is perfect for their cultivation.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Chartres :</u></strong> It would be a shame to visit the Centre Val-de-Loire without going to Chartres. You would miss its gothic cathedral, which is a Unesco World Heritage Site. You would also miss its upper and lower medieval towns.
                You could also have extended your day with a walk along the banks of the Eure. Or with an excursion to the Picassiette house, an unusual house decorated with pieces of plates.</li><br>
