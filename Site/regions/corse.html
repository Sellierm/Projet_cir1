            <h2>Presentation of the region :</h2>
            <br>
            <p>It is called the Island of Beauty for its sublime landscapes between red cliffs plunging into turquoise waters, stone villages clinging to the mountain and gorges planted with chestnut trees. Small coves or fine sandy beaches, peninsulas or capes... In Corsica, more than 1000 kilometers of coastline invite you to take nature walks between sky and sea, as in the emblematic Scandola reserve, popular for scuba diving. But Napoleon's homeland is also a land of traditions and history, to be discovered during a walk in its cities nestled in the shelter of their citadels, with their feet in the Mediterranean !</p>

            <h2>Important places to visit :</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The Cap Corse :</u></strong> The Cape is the wild version of Corsica. At the extreme north of the island, this peninsula is 40 km long and 15 km at its widest point. The Corsicans call it "the island within the island", which tells you about its preserved and authentic character. What really surprises, even more than in the rest of Corsica, is the explosive mix of sea and mountain. Take the road along the coastline for magnificent views of the sea-beaten cliffs and surrounding mountains.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The Calanches of Piana :</u></strong> One of Corsica's must-sees, the Calanche de Piana have been listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1983. These pink granite rocks form caves, cavities and promontories that delight the eye. The turquoise coves are ideal for swimming and snorkelling. The natural pool of Capo Rosso, only four metres deep, reveals the beauty of the underwater world. There are many walks to discover the creeks, but you can also cross them by car.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The Reserve of Scandola :</u></strong> 900 hectares of protected land and 1000 hectares of protected sea: the Scandola Reserve, a Unesco World Heritage Site, is a small eden. It is a collapsed volcano that has shaped the peninsula to give it its air of the end of the world. It can only be reached by boat as its rugged terrain makes it impossible to go by land. A must for birdwatchers, this area managed by the Corsican Regional Nature Park is home to ospreys, gulls, shearwaters, peregrine falcons... The flora covers the red rock cliffs in profusion. You can also take a trip into the water armed with your mask and snorkel, you can meet the exceptional aquatic life and even come across tuna, swordfish or dolphins.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Bonifacio :</u></strong> In the far south of Corsica, beautiful Bonifacio has all the makings of a postcard city. Standing on a rocky limestone promontory, its imposing cliffs frame a charming town. Dream beaches also attract summer visitors.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The Aiguilles of Bavella :</u></strong> The very essence of the Corsican mountains? The Aiguilles de Bavella, without a doubt. 30 minutes from Solenzara and 1h45 from Bonifacio, these impressive rocks rise towards the sky in the middle of a forest of laurel pines. The largest, Punta di u Furnullu, reaches 900 metres in height. Numerous hiking trails venture into the Aiguilles to let you admire the surrounding nature. Even if the GR20 passes through here, amateur hikers will find paths for all levels. The most accessible hike is to the "trou de la bombe": in one hour, in the shade of the trees, you will reach this amazing geological curiosity.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Bastia :</u></strong> The "capital" of northern Corsica is not lacking in character. Bastia is one of the gateways for travellers coming from the continent to the "island of beauty". The Palace of the Governors, former residence of the rulers of Genoa, is a beautiful building that should be visited first. During your stroll through the old town, don't miss St. Nicholas Square, the heart of the city. The small port is not without its charm, with its atmosphere that seems to have come straight out of another era and its fleet of colourful boats. This is where you can enjoy excellent local cuisine in the many restaurants. Finally, leave the city centre and walk about 20 minutes to the picturesque Scala Santa chapel, which has a 'holy staircase' recognised by Pope Pius VII himself.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Ajaccio :</u></strong> You can't go to Corsica without visiting its capital! The beautiful Ajaccio deserves at least one day to discover its old town, museums and beaches, and one or two more days to venture out into its surroundings.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>GR20 :</u></strong> The GR20, a mythical path! Known to all hiking enthusiasts, it crosses the whole of Corsica from north to south, even passing through a mountain range. If some hikers cover the whole route (allow a good two weeks if you take your time), it is also possible to do only a few stages. You will have unforgettable memories of the magnificent views of the sea and the arduous passage of the passes and ridges. There are about 15 stages on the route, which is considered one of the most beautiful treks in the world. The difficulty of walking in the high mountains is largely compensated by the pleasure of discovering Corsica from the inside.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>The Lavezza Isles :</u></strong> 20 minutes by boat from Bonifacio, the Lavezzi archipelago is composed of 23 islands and islets. This nature reserve is a unique place accessible by sea. There are no facilities on the islands, so bring your own picnic and anything else you need on site. You'll enjoy exploring the lush paths on long walks, then relaxing in one of the many coves overlooking the Mediterranean. The Lavezzi Islands are often compared to the Seychelles, which tells you what kind of landscapes await you...)</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Calvi :</u></strong> Calvi is one of the most emblematic towns in northern Corsica. This beautiful seaside town is appreciated for the charm of its old town and for its magnificent beach, one of the most beautiful on the island. It overlooks a vast gulf, offering a panorama that is worth seeing from the top of its hill.</li><br>
                <li><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i>  <strong><u>Porto-Vecchio :</u></strong> In the south-east of Corsica, Porto-Vecchio is the third most populated town in Corsica. The "city of salt", as it is called in memory of its salt marshes, has many assets to offer the visitor. Not far from there, there are two anthology beaches, Palombaggia and Santa Giulia.</li><br>
